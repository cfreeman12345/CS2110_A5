# CS2110_A5
This project implements a "click the dot" game.  Dots will appear one at a time, and the player must click the dot before it disappears.  A total of 10 dots will appear, making the maximum score 10.  The size of the dot and the speed at which they disappear can be adjusted with sliders on either side of the window.  This was a project for CS2110.
